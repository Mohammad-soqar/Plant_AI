# Plant AI App ðŸŒ±

Plant AI App is a mobile application designed to identify plants and provide care instructions using AI technology. The app integrates with the **Plant.id API** provided by Kindwise to offer accurate plant identification and health assessment capabilities.

## Features

- **Plant Identification**: Identify indoor plants, wildflowers, trees, grasses, and other plant species from images.
- **Health Assessment**: Evaluate the health of plants and detect potential diseases or pests.
- **Care Instructions**: Provide detailed guidance on optimal watering, light conditions, and soil types for identified plants.
- **Search History**: Keep track of past identifications for easy reference.
- **Photo Sharing**: Share plant identification results with friends and family.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development)
- **Backend**: Firebase & Node.js
- **API**: [Plant.id API v3 by Kindwise](https://www.kindwise.com/plant-id)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install Flutter SDK on your machine. Refer to the [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for more details.
- Obtain an API key from the [Plant.id API](https://web.plant.id/) by registering an account.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-soqar/Plant_AI.git
   cd plant-ai-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure the environment:
   - Navigate to the `utils` folder.
   - Create the `env.dart` and create the `Env` class in with your specific API keys and configuration:
     ```dart
     class Env {
       static const String apiBaseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
       static const String plantIdApiKey = 'your_plant_id_api_key';
       static const String firebaseProjectId = 'your_firebase_project_id';
     }
     ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
### API Integration

This app leverages the Plant.id API for its core functionalities. The API provides two key services:
1. **Identification**: Determines the plant species from one or more images.
2. **Health Assessment**: Evaluates the health of the plant and detects potential diseases.

To use these services:
- Ensure the API key is included in all requests using the `Api-Key` header.
- Refer to the [Plant.id API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24599534/2s93z5A4v2) for details on request parameters and response structures.
